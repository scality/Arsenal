/**
 * Cache of listing "gaps" i.e. ranges of keys that can be skipped
 * over during listing (because they only contain delete markers as
 * latest versions).
 *
 * Typically, a single GapCache instance would be attached to a raft session.
 *
 * The API usage is as follows:
 *
 * - Initialize a GapCache instance by calling start() (this starts an internal timer)
 *
 * - Insert a gap or update an existing one via setGap()
 *
 * - Lookup existing gaps via lookupGap()
 *
 * - Invalidate gaps that overlap a specific set of keys via removeOverlappingGaps()
 *
 * - Shut down a GapCache instance by calling stop() (this stops the internal timer)
 *
 * Gaps inserted via setGap() are not exposed immediately to lookupGap(), but only:
 *
 * - after a certain delay always larger than 'exposureDelayMs' and usually shorter
 *   than twice this value (but might be slightly longer in rare cases)
 *
 * - and only if they haven't been invalidated by a recent call to removeOverlappingGaps()
 *
 * This ensures atomicity between gap creation and invalidation from updates under
 * the condition that a gap is created from first key to last key within the time defined
 * by 'exposureDelayMs'.
 *
 * The implementation is based on two extra temporary "update sets" on top of the main
 * exposed gap set, one called "staging" and the other "frozen", each containing a
 * temporary updated gap set and a list of updated keys to invalidate gaps with (coming
 * from calls to removeOverlappingGaps()). Every "exposureDelayMs" milliseconds, the frozen
 * gaps are invalidated by all key updates coming from either of the "staging" or "frozen"
 * update set, then merged into the exposed gaps set, after which the staging updates become
 * the frozen updates and won't receive any new gap until the next cycle.
