# bucket_mem design

## RATIONALE

The bucket API will be used for managing buckets behind the S3 interface.

We plan to have only 2 backends using this interface:

* One production backend
* One debug backend purely in memory

One important remark here is that we don't want an abstraction but a
duck-typing style interface (different classes MemoryBucket and Bucket having
the same methods putObjectMD(), getObjectMD(), etc).

Notes about the memory backend: The backend is currently a simple key/value
store in memory. The functions actually use nextTick() to emulate the future
asynchronous behavior of the production backend.

## BUCKET API

The bucket API is a very simple API with 5 functions:

- putObjectMD(): put metadata for an object in the bucket
- getObjectMD(): get metadata from the bucket
- deleteObjectMD(): delete metadata for an object from the bucket
- deleteBucketMD(): delete a bucket
- getBucketListObjects(): perform the complex bucket listing AWS search
  function with various flavors. This function returns a response in a
  ListBucketResult object.

getBucketListObjects(prefix, marker, delimiter, maxKeys, callback) behavior is
the following:

prefix (not required): Limits the response to keys that begin with the
specified prefix. You can use prefixes to separate a bucket into different
groupings of keys. (You can think of using prefix to make groups in the same
way you'd use a folder in a file system.)

marker (not required): Specifies the key to start with when listing objects in
a bucket. Amazon S3 returns object keys in alphabetical order, starting with
key after the marker in order.

delimiter (not required): A delimiter is a character you use to group keys.
All keys that contain the same string between the prefix, if specified, and the
first occurrence of the delimiter after the prefix are grouped under a single
result element, CommonPrefixes. If you don't specify the prefix parameter, then
the substring starts at the beginning of the key. The keys that are grouped
under CommonPrefixes are not returned elsewhere in the response.

maxKeys: Sets the maximum number of keys returned in the response body. You can
add this to your request if you want to retrieve fewer than the default 1000
keys.  The response might contain fewer keys but will never contain more. If
there are additional keys that satisfy the search criteria but were not
returned because maxKeys was exceeded, the response contains an attribute of
IsTruncated set to true and a NextMarker. To return the additional keys, call
the function again using NextMarker as your marker argument in the function.

Any key that does not contain the delimiter will be returned individually in
Contents rather than in CommonPrefixes.

If there is an error, the error subfield is returned in the response.
